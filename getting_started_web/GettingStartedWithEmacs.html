  <h2>Get Emacs</h2>
  <p>You can usually install emacs in a Linux system using your
    distribution's tools (rpm, yum, apt, Package Manager, etc.).
    However, check the version of emacs you get that way -- some
    distributions still have a pretty old version. You want version
    23.4 at least. Version 23 has the packaging 
    system we'll be discussing in a minute.</p>
  <p>For windows, go to https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs. Visit the
    <em><a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Obtaining">Obtaining</a></em>
    section and click the link to go to a mirror. You'll be presented
    with a directory listing. Click on "windows/" and get a new list.
    Scroll down to the bottom, where they keep the newest files for
    some reason, and click on "emacs-24.3-bin-i386.zip" &mdash; or a
    later version if one is available.
