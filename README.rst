Important Note
--------------

    The emacs initialization which is in this project is now
    officially obsolete; it's being moved to the emacs24-starter-kit_
    repository.

Various Emacs program files, of interest mostly to me.

I've set up some customization options in files I can share across the
multiple systems where I run Emacs, as well as a file to use Cask to
manage installed packages.

Some of the Lisp code has tests. According to travis-ci.org currently they are:
