*Important Note*
The emacs iniitialization which is in this project is now officially obsolete;
it's being moved to the emacs24-starter-kit repository.

Various emacs initialization and program files, of interest mostly to me.

I've set up some customization options in file I can share across the
multiple systems where I run emacs, as well as a file to use Cask to
manage installed packages.

Some of the Lisp code has tests, according to travis-ci.org currently they are:
