* TODO Learn to use org mode

* TODO Start organizing project using org notes

* GOALS

I've used a service called XMarks (http://www.xmarks.com) to
maintain lists of URLs of particular interest (known as bookmarks
or favorites). Even after firefox et al. add bookmarks synch,
xmarks is nice in that it allows synchronization of bookmarks
between different browsers. Unfortunately, xmarks has become
unreliable, (apparently) unable to handle the constantly-changing
browser bookmark functionality. I end up with duplicated bookmarks,
entire duplicate trees, bookmark folders with nothing in them, etc.

So I want to take charge of my own bookmark management.

** Import bookmarks from all major browsers
*** Use browser export functionality, parse files.
*** Later: pull bookmarks directly from however the browser stores them
** Provide bookmark management functionality
*** UI interface to add, delete, move bookmarks in folders
*** detect duplicate bookmarks
*** Test bookmarks to determine if target reachable
*** Maintain notes about sites, etc. beyond browser bookmark functionality
** Export bookmarks to all major browsers
** Store data in cloud
*** Using user-configured service
*** Some standard storage location?
*** Provide web services and server?
